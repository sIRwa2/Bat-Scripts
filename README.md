Collection of Windows .BAT scripts created by chatGPT as prompted by me.

AIF2WAV.bat will create a sub directory and convert .aif files to .wav

lenght and Merge.bat is created to merge singe shot drum audio files togheter in a singel audio file to use on the octatrack.
lenght and Merge.bat will analyze all audio clips in folder, ad half a second to the longest lenght and then make all audio clips that same lenght before merging them in a single .wav file
This script cant handle .aif so use the AIF2WAV.bat to convert your aif files first!
